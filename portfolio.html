                <h3>Welcome to my Personal Webpage!</h3>

                <p>
                    I am Teo Wei Jie, a <b>Year 1</b> student from <a href="https://www.np.edu.sg/"
                            target="_blank">Ngee Ann Polytechnic</a>, and I am currently pursing a <a
                            href="https://www.np.edu.sg/ict/Pages/it.aspx"
                            target="_blank">Diploma in Information Technology</a>
                            On top of that, I am also pursuing a second Diploma in Outdoor Adventure Learning. 

                        Here you will find more information about me, including my <a href="#leadership">Leadership</a>,
                        <a href="#achievements">Achievements</a>, and my <a href="#testimonial">Testimonial</a>.

                    I'm the kind of person who likes to manage data, especially when these data are used to help the society 
                        in terms of data handling and finance. I love to play with database as the data can be used for meaningful 
                        purposes like setting up a school system with many different classes. I feel a sense of accomplishment when 
                        the database is structured, but sometimes, huge database requires multiple personnel working on it. Therefore, 
                        the segregating of duties is needed. AKA, Standard Operating Procedure. Usually after a few glance of how things 
                        are done, I would pick up things fast.

                    My side hobby includes taking photographs and this prompts me to join the Photography Club in Ngee Ann Polytechnic to expand

                        The second CCA I have is Scouts as it was my CCA in secondary school, I am still actively involved with the programs and activities. I love to seek adventures as I like to be 
                        exposed to variety of outdoor activities such as trekking, hiking, running, kayaking, and playing basketball. I like to be exposed to sun, adventure and sports.

                <h2>Leadership</h2>
                <hr>

                <p>
                    Coming from <a href="https://jurongsec.moe.edu.sg/" target="_blank">Jurong Secondary School</a>, 
                    a leadership position is not hard to obtain as there are many opportunities for everyone
                    to have. For me, I started my leadership journey as my Class Monitor in 2013. It wasn't a 
                    big achievement but it was a small step. When I progress to secondary 2, I was selected to 
                    be the student councillor and went for my interview. To my surprise, I got it
                    and soon after, I also obtained a simple leadership role in my CCA - Scouts which I was then promoted to be
                    the Troop Leader of Scouts which was a tough period for me. Having to juggle between Class Monitor, Student councillor,
                     and CCA Leader, it was a stressful year but I am glad that I had the chance to experience leadership.
                     If it wasn't for those stressfull period, I wouldn't have grown to be the person I am today.
