Wei Jie's Portfolio & Blog
This website covers my Portfolio and Blog for future employers to look at for hire. It has details such as my Testimonial, Achievements, Leadership, Hobbies and About Me.

Design Process:

This Website was created with the intent of sharing my personal life with employers who are looking to hire. I included some personal achievements and volunteer experience to show my efforts outside of school ciriculum.

I created this website with proper color contrast so that text will be visible instead of poor contrast.

In this website, user can get a look of my picture in the Home Page (Index.html) so they will get a glimpse of who I am. 
I didn't want this website to be too formal, but add a pinch of my cheerful personality. Hence, the less formal Photo in the Home Page.

The Home page has nothing as I want the user interface to attract employers attention without too much text which might be too formal and boring.

Moving on to the next page (Portfolio.html) I included some common items found in a portfolio like my Course of Study, Why I chose the course, CCAs and Side Hobbies, Leadership Experience, Achievements, Testimonial and a Form for employers to leave any queries or send an Email.

Lastly, my Blog Page (blog.html) which has my thoughts on my Life in Ngee Ann and Life in Scouts. This was included for employers or readers to read and understand what I go through in School and Outside School.
